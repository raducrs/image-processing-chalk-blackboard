# image-processing-chalk-blackboard
Image processing to transform an image into a chalk drawing on a blackboard using `OpenCV`

## Example 

It works best with a blackboard background

Original Image | Background | Result 
--- | --- | ---
![original](images/github_avatar.jpg) | ![background](images/blackboard_wide_2.png) | ![result](images/github_avatar_blackboard.jpg)


**Example as AWS Lambda (with OpenCV layer) with advanced features in [another repository](https://github.com/raducrs/tableta-inmultirii-aws-lambda/tree/main/imageprocessing/TI-ImageChalk)**
